Arm11™ core running at 532 MHz with 90 nm technology. 
- TeraChip
  - Verification for their 2nd gen switch fabric. 1st gen, targetting OC192 (10 Gbps) and OC48 (2.5 Gbps) applications, is described [here](https://www.eetimes.com/startup-pushes-shared-memory-switch-fabric-ic/) and [here](https://www.lightreading.com/network-technology/terachip-unveils-switch-fabrics).
- TMX Silicon
  - Worked on a next gen SOC processor architecture.
- Ericsson
  - Verification of 2.5 generations of network processors for the IP9000 edge routing platform that combined a cell-based switch fabric with an advanced ASIC design. See [here](https://washingtontechnology.com/1997/11/torrent-networking-technologies-prepares-for-internet-traffic-deluge/325552/) and [here](https://www.hpcwire.com/1998/05/22/torrent-notes-results-tolly-group-tests-ip9000-router/).
